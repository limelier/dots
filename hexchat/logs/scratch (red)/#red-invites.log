Apr 08 23:35:42 *	Gatekeeper removes ban on TimK!*@*
Apr 08 23:35:55 <disdyakis>	yea then just make sure your computer doesn't sleep or lose its internet connection
Apr 08 23:36:37 <limelier>	that'll be a bit difficult, since i dual boot a lot... might have to find a weekend where i really don't need one of the OSes, I guess
Apr 08 23:40:14 <disdyakis>	setting up a znc might work well for you then - i don't think that's discouraged as long as it's hosted from your home internet connection
Apr 08 23:40:27 <limelier>	i'll look into that, then. thanks for the tips
Apr 08 23:41:39 <disdyakis>	or i guess is should say, i am not in any way an authority here, but the irc rules seem to be focused on making sure you're always logging in from your home internet connection, and i've seen nothing one way or another about zrc so i'd assume it's fine lol

Apr 08 23:46:24 <disdyakis>	ah that makes sense - i guess i was thinking if a bouncer is hosted on your home network it would count as directly connected
Apr 08 23:46:50 <geraffs>	even if it's hosted on local, I wouldn't risk it
Apr 08 23:48:48 <limelier>	god damn it
Apr 08 23:48:56 <disdyakis>	out of curiosity where did you get that quote from - the topic just has a bit that says "HOME CONNECTION ONLY"

Apr 08 23:49:43 <geraffs>	under the "connecting to RED's irc"

Apr 08 23:51:34 <geraffs>	yeah, it's on the Starting the Interview page

Apr 09 11:46:04 *	Received a CTCP VERSION from Gatekeeper
Apr 09 11:46:17 <disdyakis>	that sounds like the kind of thing parents say that isn't true
Apr 09 11:47:32 <Folklord>	I like to believe that. lol
Apr 09 11:47:58 <disdyakis>	to clarify, i don't usualy have my desktop on 24/7 (it's usually sleeping), i do have a home server that's always on
Apr 09 11:49:32 <AsparagusOmelette>	is the server a dedicated device, or just a repurposed headless desktop?
Apr 09 11:49:38 <AsparagusOmelette>	or a pi maybe?
Apr 09 11:49:49 <disdyakis>	my mom would always unplug my chargers that didn't have anything plugged into them - and i tried explaining to her that if it's just sitting in the wall it's using at most $0.01 of electricity a year and that was not worth the inconvinience of my phone randomly dying because i thought it was charging but it wasn't
Apr 09 11:50:30 <disdyakis>	the later - it's an intel nuc with a 10tb external harddrive
Apr 09 11:50:47 <limelier>	oh hey, you're still here
Apr 09 11:51:33 <disdyakis>	i live here now
Apr 09 11:51:33 <Folklord>	I guess I'll queue another time.
Apr 09 11:51:36 <limelier>	no luck, then?
Apr 09 11:51:49 <disdyakis>	nope still #4
Apr 09 11:51:52 <limelier>	oof
Apr 09 11:51:59 <limelier>	i guess right now people are just busy
Apr 09 11:52:16 <limelier>	and theres probably a backlog of interviewees after the outage last week or so
Apr 09 11:52:43 <Folklord>	Oh, I see. Thanks for the info.
Apr 09 11:53:04 <Folklord>	I noticed last week the interview process was paused.
Apr 09 11:53:12 <limelier>	i just queue up now to see how the queue is doing
Apr 09 11:53:29 <disdyakis>	yea fairs fair - i'm just glad that the queue didn't pass me up while i was out running errands today - idk if the boba i got on my way home would have been worth it, but it was really good boba so maybe it would have been
Apr 09 11:53:39 <limelier>	i don't think i can get to the front of the queue unless i get a device i can leave running for a few days
Apr 09 11:57:35 *	Gatekeeper removes ban on *!*@red-blo.87b.8ca67l.IP
Apr 09 11:58:05 <disdyakis>	yea that sounds accurate - i also queued up a few months ago - maybe closer to a year ago now :o - and i think i was queued up for a couple of days and had to disconnect because i was going out of town for the weekend
Apr 09 11:58:55 <disdyakis>	so i think that's just how it is, and isn't unique to this week
Apr 09 11:59:14 <limelier>	honestly, i can understand that these interviews are all powered by volunteers doing it for free and they're not going to be very fast
Apr 09 11:59:22 <limelier>	that's fine
Apr 09 11:59:50 <limelier>	i just wish there was a more sane way to queue up in a process that'll apparently take multiple days
Apr 09 12:00:45 <limelier>	as it stands it's very a very limiting process
Apr 09 12:01:33 <limelier>	to have to connect from home and stay online for days at a time... i guess it favors people who will be able to seed the most as well but it still doesn't seem that solid of a process
Apr 09 12:01:34 <disdyakis>	yea idk what the replacement would look like though - maybe once you get in you could spearhead an update :P
Apr 09 12:02:35 <limelier>	i'm not sure either, perhaps keeping your spot in the queue for 24h and allowing you to retake it when you come online
Apr 09 12:02:35 <disdyakis>	it did take me a year into the pandemic to realize that sheltering in place, working from home, and not going on vacations is the perfect recipe for queueing up for this process
Apr 09 12:03:21 <limelier>	the thing that stops me from just powering through things by leaving my laptop on for a week is the fact that i dual boot between linux and windows
Apr 09 12:03:28 <limelier>	and i need both for college and stuff :/
Apr 09 12:04:02 <geraffs>	welcome back limelier!
Apr 09 12:04:05 <limelier>	hi
Apr 09 12:04:25 <geraffs>	hi o/
Apr 09 12:04:55 <limelier>	it sucks too because the strict interviewing rules prevent any reasonable alternatives for me too
Apr 09 12:05:16 <limelier>	like using a ZNC, or booting up my old desktop without a screen and SSHing into it to queue
Apr 09 12:07:03 <geraffs>	my laptop and irc client is on 24/7 so it doesn't change anything for me
Apr 09 12:07:15 <limelier>	well, it's good that you have that option
Apr 09 12:07:25 <limelier>	sadly not everybody does
Apr 09 12:07:35 <Kristophersson>	sup everyone
Apr 09 12:07:37 <limelier>	hi
Apr 09 12:07:51 <geraffs>	hello
Apr 09 12:07:54 <disdyakis>	yea i'm curious the exact reasoning behind some of the irc rules because i'm not super familiar with irc and in general, i know very little about networking despite literally taking a course on it
Apr 09 12:08:19 <limelier>	i'm guessing a lot of the rules are to ensure you don't sidestep the "interview from a home connection" rule
Apr 09 12:08:21 <Kristophersson>	so from the sound of this chat it should be safe to keep my laptop running in the queue while I go home to my parents over the weekend?
Apr 09 12:08:25 <limelier>	probably
Apr 09 12:09:05 <limelier>	disdyakis: what i mean is, i'm guessing people would use a vpn, or an SSH server, or something else to connect from their "home connection" while away from home
Apr 09 12:10:16 <Kristophersson>	I mean you aren't even allowed to use a remote desktop application to take the interview. to me it sounds like they're trying to make it purposfully make it hard to join.
Apr 09 12:10:22 <limelier>	iunno. i understand being selective, and i'm thankful that RED even takes new users at all, but I do wish the process made a bit more... sense
Apr 09 12:11:06 <limelier>	it doesn't really take a rocket scientist to not upload trash and keep up a good ratio
Apr 09 12:11:28 <limelier>	to me it seems like the interview queuing process is way bigger of a hurdle than the interview itself
Apr 09 12:11:32 <disdyakis>	yea, i guess my specific question is, are the rules just written to gauruntee you're at home on your home connection, or is there other rationale behind banning setups where you are at home on your home connection, but want to protect yourself from disconnecting - like maybe there was an issue in the past with people being away from their computers but still being on irc?
Apr 09 12:12:24 <limelier>	i doubt that, because as it stands there's nothing stopping you from just leaving your pc open and going somewhere else
Apr 09 12:12:44 <disdyakis>	yea because like, if the queue moves up while i'm sleeping that's essentially the same as if i had a znc on my home server to keep me in this room even if my desktop shut off so idk
Apr 09 12:12:55 <limelier>	yeah
Apr 09 12:13:28 <disdyakis>	so, like i said, i'm curious what the rationale is - it does sound like the kind of rule one makes when a loophole was abused in the past
Apr 09 12:13:28 <limelier>	i would understand the really strict connection rules if you could feasibly queue up in the morning and actually get interviewed by the evening
Apr 09 12:13:56 <limelier>	but its not, and i can understand that. like they say, everyone who interviews volunteers to do it for free, they don't have that much free time to waste
Apr 09 12:14:09 <limelier>	but in that case it sounds like maybe the queueing process shouldn't be so restrictive
Apr 09 12:14:35 <disdyakis>	yea - it's also totally possible it's just entrenched in the interview process
Apr 09 12:14:54 <limelier>	maybe my hunch was right, and they are specifically trying to filter people who can't keep their pcs on all the time (to seed)
Apr 09 12:14:56 <disdyakis>	the red interview process up until the interview itself (which i have not yet taken) is identical to the what.cd one
Apr 09 12:14:57 <limelier>	hm
Apr 09 12:15:19 <limelier>	oh, i'm not familiar. this is my first private tracker interview
Apr 09 12:15:22 <Kristophersson>	I think it's mainly to combat cheaters. As to not make it easy for them to create duplicate accounts or whatever. But it's sad that that is at the cost of all the legitimate interested
Apr 09 12:15:29 <limelier>	yeah
Apr 09 12:15:39 <limelier>	it's a bit disheartening
Apr 09 12:16:30 <disdyakis>	yea it doesn't sound like it's to filter out people who can't seed as much because my home server is going to be my seedbox essentially because it has a wired connection to my router
Apr 09 12:16:57 <limelier>	i guess i'll just stay queued here for a while and see if there's any news
Apr 09 12:17:03 <limelier>	doubt i'll be getting to the front any time soon, though
Apr 09 12:17:27 <limelier>	good luck to you, disdyakis. maybe you can get a better idea of what's going on when you get in
Apr 09 12:19:59 <Kristophersson>	limeliner you might want to try getting into other ones first, to get some experience and whatnot. I am on a bunch of general content trackers and I hope that'll help my interview. Just browse reddit.com/r/opensignups, where people post if their tracker has signups available. Many private trackers also recruit on other trackers, so that could also be a way for you to get into more exclusive ones. I believe you can use this tracker 
Apr 09 12:19:59 <Kristophersson>	for reference for another high-level tracker, though I don't remember which. So, can't hurt to get into a couple of private trackers. I definitely recommend blu, a great general content tracker, and losslessclub for music
Apr 09 12:20:34 <limelier>	i see, thanks! i'll be sure to check those out
Apr 09 12:20:57 <Kristophersson>	many trackers also require "proof", screenshots of your profile on another tracker, if you wish to sign up without an invite, so having a small collection definitely is an advantage
Apr 09 12:21:07 <limelier>	alright

Apr 10 01:27:34 <AsparagusOmelette>	ouch, sorry man
Apr 10 01:29:27 <Capacity4444>	ooof, bummer.  sorry to hear that man
Apr 10 01:30:51 <AsparagusOmelette>	i'm also probably going to the back of the que in an hour, unless i figure out why it consistently disconnects me at 01:27
Apr 10 01:46:30 <geraffs>	AsparagusOmelette: maybe your router has a reboot schedule?
Apr 10 01:51:54 <AsparagusOmelette>	i'm fairly sure it doesn't, though the DHCP refresh was set to 1 day, i'll set it to 3 weeks and cross my fingers

Apr 10 17:08:38 *	Received a CTCP VERSION from Gatekeeper
Apr 10 17:09:19 <limelier>	i think i have a suggestion that could help ease the queuing process for people who can't, for some reason, have the same device on at all times
Apr 10 17:09:23 <limelier>	(like my and my dual booting)
Apr 10 17:10:29 <limelier>	how about a !cede <user> command that would give your spot in the queue to another currently queued user? that way you could connect a second time on your home network, cede your spot to that connection, and then disconnect from the first one
Apr 10 17:11:57 <limelier>	someone like me could then do this twice (laptop -> phone -> laptop) to mantain a queue spot through a device restart
