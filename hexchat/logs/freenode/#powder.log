Apr 01 13:45:59 <Ristovski>	we've been made! self-destruct
Apr 01 13:46:09 <Ristovski>	limelier: spaghetti, but this time more organized
Apr 01 13:46:16 <limelier>	that's what they all say
Apr 01 13:46:30 <Ristovski>	not that big yet, we don't play /that/ much
Apr 01 13:46:33 <limelier>	how far along are you?
Apr 01 13:46:35 <limelier>	also, mods?
Apr 01 14:04:20 <Ristovski>	limelier: no mods, and we basically reached kovarex, so early mid-game
Apr 01 14:06:02 <limelier>	i see, neat

Apr 02 21:38:21 *	Doxin (~Doxin@unaffiliated/doxin) has joined
Apr 02 21:38:34 <SpiritOfSummer>	ah yes, hello Doxin. 
Apr 02 21:38:40 <Doxin>	man, chemical wood burning is a fun technique
Apr 02 21:38:49 <SpiritOfSummer>	as it sounds
Apr 02 21:38:56 <Doxin>	hm?
Apr 02 21:39:02 <SpiritOfSummer>	it sounds as if it would be fun 
Apr 02 21:39:04 <savask>	Doxin: What is used for that? Some sort of acid?
Apr 02 21:39:30 <Doxin>	savask: yes but also no
Apr 02 21:39:44 <Doxin>	it's a super benign chemical that decomposes into acid when you heat it
Apr 02 21:40:18 <Doxin>	savask: ammonium chloride dissolved in water
Apr 02 21:40:44 <Doxin>	the one thing I haven't quite figured out yet is how to get crisp lines, the stuff seeps into the wood making the burned area bleed a bit
Apr 02 21:41:03 <Doxin>	you basically just brush it on, and then point a heat gun at it. the treated area will burn in seconds
Apr 02 21:43:32 <savask>	I see
Apr 02 21:44:19 <Doxin>	it's quite a pretty effect, the bleed is even nice if using something like ariel bold :P
Apr 02 21:44:20 <savask>	Doxin: The smell must be something
Apr 02 21:44:27 <Doxin>	smells like burnt wood mostly
Apr 02 21:44:42 <Doxin>	the chemical itself is pretty much odorless
Apr 02 21:44:55 <savask>	What
Apr 02 21:46:10 <savask>	Ah, I misinterpreted it
Apr 02 21:46:32 <savask>	Ammonia smells bad
Apr 02 21:46:47 <Doxin>	ah right
Apr 02 21:47:03 <Skylark>	Doxin: salmiak
Apr 02 21:47:11 <Doxin>	I mean technically this stuff is supposed to decompose into ammonia and hydrochloric acid, but it's such minute amounts I don't think there's enough for a smell
Apr 02 21:47:12 <Doxin>	Skylark: yep
Apr 02 21:47:20 <Skylark>	technically this stuff is supposed to be put in liquorice
Apr 02 21:47:25 <Doxin>	Skylark: stuff is cheap A/F too :P
Apr 02 21:47:36 <Skylark>	yeah it is. well it's not exactly fine chemistry
Apr 02 21:47:42 <Doxin>	and yes it goes very well with licorice :3
Apr 02 21:53:00 <limelier>	oh shoot people are talking

Apr 02 22:00:08 <limelier>	at least when i send dark themes to Eyess i know they're gonna talk shit about them 
Apr 02 22:00:19 <Doxin>	well I mean the dark theme is one issue
Apr 02 22:00:27 <Doxin>	add to that the flat theme
Apr 02 22:00:36 <Doxin>	tiling wm is nice, but then you go and have one with margins
Apr 02 22:01:04 <limelier>	well, it's a pretty particular aesthetic
Apr 02 22:01:11 <limelier>	but it's one i like a lot
Apr 02 22:02:12 <Doxin>	well like I said
Apr 02 22:02:14 <Doxin>	gay as heck

Apr 06 18:20:07 <Ristovski>	savask: more ram == more cache == less disk usage, maybe I can finally migrate to ssd
Apr 06 18:20:16 <savask>	Oh
Apr 06 18:20:28 <savask>	Ristovski: But do you want gentoo on your SSD
Apr 06 18:20:48 <Ristovski>	savask: I mean, I would move stuff that gets written to (when compiling gentoo stuff) to the hdd
Apr 06 18:20:56 <Ristovski>	and use the hdd as long term "storage"
Apr 06 18:21:20 <savask>	Ristovski: I meant, didn't you want to switch from gentoo to something else
Apr 06 18:21:29 <savask>	If so, then why take the effort and reinstall gentoo on ssd
Apr 06 18:21:32 <Ristovski>	savask: nothing else is as good
Apr 06 18:21:40 <Ristovski>	which is sad, but true
Apr 06 18:21:46 <savask>	I thought pretty much everything is better than gentoo
Apr 06 18:21:53 <Ristovski>	lol
Apr 06 18:22:03 <savask>	Like, take any distro without systemd
Apr 06 18:22:30 <Ristovski>	savask: might as well just make my own distro then

Apr 06 18:24:14 <Ristovski>	savask: I actually came up with an idea I need to ponder on further
Apr 06 18:24:36 <savask>	?
Apr 06 18:25:41 <Ristovski>	savask: Don't know how feasible it is, but I could have Gentoo as a "base", and then run VMs/containers with something like Arch or w/e to run random crap
Apr 06 18:25:59 <savask>	Jesus christ
Apr 06 18:26:00 <Ristovski>	savask: which makes sense, I would only want to run a couple of things "natively" on gentoo anyways
Apr 06 18:26:43 <Ristovski>	savask: You laugh but it would actually be /more/ efficient if I tinker with qemu enough
Apr 06 18:27:06 <Ristovski>	(to implement "suspending" VMs etc, or where it allocates only a fraction of CPU time to a VM in background, given nothing critical is running in it)
Apr 06 18:27:26 <savask>	I can't imagine a sane usecase for that

Apr 07 13:24:21 <hhes>	yeah, but it sucks less
Apr 07 13:24:23 <Doxin>	they move complexity out of the language into your programs
Apr 07 13:25:04 <hhes>	it's kinda true, but at the same time adding complexity to the language and actually get into the way while using it
Apr 07 13:25:04 <limelier>	Doxin: i... don't know :(
Apr 07 13:25:10 <mniip>	limelier, safety is an investment that takes a while to reap the benefits of
Apr 07 13:25:12 <Doxin>	lol
Apr 07 13:25:23 <hhes>	s/the language/the language can/
Apr 07 13:25:33 <hhes>	fuck, s/can and/can/
Apr 07 13:25:34 <Doxin>	hhes: okay but consider: D is super simple, and yet doesn't move complexity into your programs
Apr 07 13:25:42 <hhes>	Doxin: I know
Apr 07 13:25:47 <hhes>	but: adoption
Apr 07 13:25:56 <Doxin>	who gives a shit?
Apr 07 13:26:02 <hhes>	inb4 with that attitude it won't be adopted ever
Apr 07 13:26:03 <mniip>	libraries
Apr 07 13:26:08 <hhes>	^
Apr 07 13:26:10 <mniip>	adoption = libraries
Apr 07 13:26:24 <limelier>	the conundrum is: i need to pick a random node from a tree, with a certain weight for leaves and a certain weight for non-leaves
Apr 07 13:26:36 <Doxin>	right
Apr 07 13:26:51 <mniip>	uniformly?
Apr 07 13:26:52 <limelier>	immutably, this is pretty easy. build an iterator for every node in the tree, use it to build a "wheel of fortune", go through that iterator and pick the right reference
Apr 07 13:26:56 <Doxin>	mniip: there's plenty of libraries for D, not to mention that C and C++ integration is hella solid
Apr 07 13:26:57 <limelier>	uniformly yeah
Apr 07 13:26:59 <hhes>	limelier: isn't there a library for that? it's rust, they've got generics so it could be generalised to any tree type
Apr 07 13:27:06 <mniip>	do you know how many nodes either side has?
Apr 07 13:27:10 <Doxin>	mniip: you can for instance throw an exception in C++ code and catch it in D code.
Apr 07 13:27:15 <limelier>	no, also it's not a binary tree
Apr 07 13:27:33 <mniip>	you might need to do counting then
Apr 07 13:27:53 <limelier>	mutably, the method i was using will absolutely not work at all because it would require an iterator of mutable references to the same tree
Apr 07 13:27:55 <limelier>	which is mega illegal
Apr 07 13:28:00 <mniip>	uh
Apr 07 13:28:12 <mniip>	why do you need mutation?
Apr 07 13:28:19 <limelier>	so i can replace that node
Apr 07 13:28:27 <hhes>	generate a new tree
Apr 07 13:28:34 <Doxin>	that's like immutable shit 101
Apr 07 13:28:49 <mniip>	you want to replace a random node in a tree?
Apr 07 13:29:06 <limelier>	yeah, i want to replace a random node in a tree (a random subtree, effectively) with another subtree
Apr 07 13:29:37 <mniip>	traverse the tree, count how many nodes and leaves there are. Do your random magic to figure out what you want to replace
Apr 07 13:29:46 <mniip>	traverse the tree again counting until you reach the desired index
Apr 07 13:29:55 <mniip>	splice
Apr 07 13:30:03 <mniip>	which you can do if you have ownership of the node
Apr 07 13:31:19 <mniip>	(disclaimer: I don't actually know rust, but I have a vague idea of linear ownership semantics)
Apr 07 13:32:18 <Doxin>	disclaimer: rust is for dweebs.
Apr 07 13:32:34 <Doxin>	the thing I dislike most about rust is all the damn directives looking like line noise
Apr 07 13:33:13 <limelier>	i might be being really thick right now but i cant really picture how you can traverse a tree to get to the nth node while only keeping one mutable reference in that tree
Apr 07 13:33:26 <limelier>	ill look into it and see what i can find
Apr 07 13:34:17 <mniip>	huh?
Apr 07 13:34:26 <mniip>	don't you own the entire tree
Apr 07 13:36:19 <limelier>	i do
Apr 07 13:39:31 <limelier>	it's just... with only one mutable reference, i don't have any way of going back up in the tree after i've gone down... ugh, i'm feeling dumb here
Apr 07 13:42:59 <mniip>	return?
Apr 07 14:10:36 <hhes>	limelier: don’t modify, create a new tree by copying nodes from the previous one

Apr 08 17:29:43 <Ristovski>	savask: greetings
Apr 08 17:33:40 <savask>	Ristovski: Hello
Apr 08 17:33:44 <savask>	What's up?
Apr 08 17:40:53 <Ristovski>	savask: hmm nothing much once again, sadly
Apr 08 17:43:07 <savask>	I see
Apr 08 18:03:39 <savask>	Ristovski: And I've finally managed to buy parker ink
Apr 08 18:03:51 <Ristovski>	savask: nice
Apr 08 18:04:05 <savask>	Ristovski: A few years ago it was 2.5 times cheaper
Apr 08 18:04:12 <savask>	Maybe I should have invested in ink
Apr 08 18:04:33 <Ristovski>	lol
Apr 08 18:20:30 <Skylark>	it doesn't keep
Apr 08 18:20:46 <Skylark>	not indefinitely anyway
Apr 08 18:23:07 <savask>	Skylark: People say it will last decades
Apr 08 18:24:11 <Skylark>	hmm maybe some do better than others. i've seen reports of microbial contamination in ink
Apr 08 18:25:08 <savask>	I had one ink bottle go bad over time, but it was very cheap russian ink (literally water + pigment)
Apr 08 18:25:37 <savask>	Parker ink on the contrary seems to last longer, at least, it doesn't develop a smell or mold
Apr 08 18:26:02 <savask>	I guess if it's kept closed it should be fine. Apparently some people use 50 year old inks without any problems
Apr 08 18:30:11 <savask>	Ristovski: Did you hear that story of a russian guy which randomly got enrolled in a chinese pop idol TV show, and now he can't go leave the show since viewers keep voting for him out of memes
Apr 08 18:30:21 <Ristovski>	savask: I have not, no
Apr 08 18:30:36 <Ristovski>	sounds amusing
Apr 08 18:31:50 <savask>	Ristovski: Well, that's it. Apparently he was helping his friends who got into a casting of that show, and producers lacked one participant for a round number. He agreed to participate since he hoped to get fired in the next round or something
Apr 08 18:32:01 <Ristovski>	savask: rofl
Apr 08 18:33:40 <savask>	Ristovski: I mean, either it's true or it's a brilliant PR campaign, but in either case he has pokerface on each episode of the show and literally does everything to slack off yet viewers vote because of memes
Apr 08 18:34:01 <Ristovski>	savask: I see, interesting
Apr 08 18:34:39 <savask>	Meanwhile americans who elected Trump because of memes: "..."
Apr 08 18:37:50 <Ristovski>	rofl
Apr 08 19:07:40 <Skylark>	i think that was marginal
Apr 08 19:19:17 <Ristovski>	kou: for the love of god fix that guys shitty PR in raspi-keygen, i told him to edit the readme and instead he makes a PR with a section "how to patch the latest version", taking up 5 fucking commits

Apr 08 23:31:33 <simtr>	Polonium annoys me because it melts at such a low temperature and stops emitting neutrons.
Apr 08 23:32:08 <Doxin>	well too late to fix that now. apparently once an element is in it is carved in stone and cannot ever be changed :P
Apr 08 23:32:18 <Doxin>	also I bet polonium doesn't do delayed radiation
Apr 08 23:32:21 <Doxin>	which is important
Apr 08 23:46:09 <Doxin>	simtr: now perhaps we can make actual nuclear reactors without having them blow through their fuel in like 0.0001 second :P
Apr 08 23:49:06 <simtr>	Well, Polonium works, you just have to keep it cool or it stalls.
Apr 08 23:49:14 <simtr>	And you can't have a real meltdown :(
Apr 08 23:50:00 <Doxin>	well thorium itself doesn't melt, but it'll sure as heck get hot enough to melt everything else :P

Apr 09 22:42:04 <limelier>	hah, i think i understood today for the first time why powder toy used to have a little pixel at the side of circles 
Apr 09 22:42:19 <limelier>	as i had to implement an algorithm for circle filling
Apr 09 22:42:38 <limelier>	its nice to have an answer to a small little part of my childhood
Apr 09 22:43:56 <limelier>	i wonder if i could find the same algorithm in the tpt source code (or in some library that it uses, i guess)
Apr 09 22:46:09 <Doxin>	limelier: I bet it's a fixable thing though. probably just an offset of 0.5 somewhere
Apr 09 23:05:06 <LBPHacker>	I like how limelier is more up to date on this than Doxin 
Apr 09 23:05:13 <LBPHacker>	it's been fixed, we have a "perfect circle" option now
Apr 09 23:05:21 <LBPHacker>	and it was indeed an offset of 0.5
Apr 09 23:09:12 <limelier>	haha
Apr 09 23:09:26 <limelier>	i bet doxin doesnt even tpt

Apr 09 23:57:19 <Ristovski>	Doxin: ikr, I wonder how feasible adding a "Usage limit" would be
Apr 09 23:57:42 <Doxin>	Ristovski: I bet it'd be doable, because ye olden blender didn't use to be this bad

Apr 10 18:34:58 <Doxin>	so is it just me or is the interface for animating 3d stuff just fucking awful
Apr 10 18:35:15 <savask>	Doxin: In blender?
Apr 10 18:35:30 <savask>	Or in general
Apr 10 18:36:04 <Doxin>	in general, but also in blender specifically
Apr 10 18:36:18 <Doxin>	though I gotta say whoever made the rig I'm using is also an assmaster because good lord
Apr 10 18:37:16 <Doxin>	(oh the hips? yes that's two bones that need to rotate simultaneously or the whole thing explodes
Apr 10 18:37:54 <savask>	It's probably just you
Apr 10 18:38:07 <Doxin>	it'd probably help if the rig was set up for IK too honestly
Apr 10 18:38:08 <savask>	I mean, people manage to animate stuff in blender, right
Apr 10 18:38:19 <Doxin>	well yeah, but that doesn't mean the interface is good
Apr 10 18:38:19 <savask>	Doxin: Are you animating a human, btw?
Apr 10 18:38:31 <Doxin>	bipedal but not human
Apr 10 18:38:48 <Doxin>	people managed to animate shit in blender 2.4 too but I hope we can agree that the interface back then was horrendous :P
Apr 10 18:39:54 <savask>	I don't remember blender 2.4 interface :C
Apr 10 18:40:10 <savask>	To be fair I haven't even animated anything in blender, the only animation software I used was Maya
Apr 10 18:40:21 <Doxin>	savask: allow me to refresh your memory: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rjeE0BY5yrM/UHFj8Gxq1qI/AAAAAAAAAAQ/E1gfpi5DSUA/s1600/blender2.4importdxf.png
Apr 10 18:40:32 <Doxin>	half the features were behind keyboard shortcuts too
Apr 10 18:40:39 <Doxin>	these days everything has buttons which is nice
Apr 10 18:40:56 <savask>	I guess
Apr 10 18:41:43 <solitaire>	jesus christ that's horrifying
Apr 10 18:41:52 <solitaire>	i knew the old blender interface was bad but not this bad
Apr 10 18:42:14 *	You are now known as limelier
Apr 10 18:42:22 <Doxin>	the old blender interface was famously terrible :P
Apr 10 18:42:28 <Doxin>	after 2.5 it improved a *lot*
Apr 10 18:42:35 <limelier>	i think the current one is okay, tbh
Apr 10 18:42:36 <Doxin>	blender has been on a damn rocket ship ever since really
Apr 10 18:42:42 <limelier>	not amazing but i have managed to animate some stuff
Apr 10 18:42:56 <limelier>	without *too* much trouble
Apr 10 18:43:00 <Doxin>	I think blender could do with being less confusing about data blocks and all that nonsense
Apr 10 18:43:10 <limelier>	data whats-its now
Apr 10 18:43:40 <Doxin>	limelier: so stuff is stored in data blocks. textures, meshes, objects. all in data blocks. which is why you can't delete textures for instance.
Apr 10 18:43:53 <Doxin>	it's an implementation detail they are exposing way too much
Apr 10 18:44:09 <limelier>	oh
Apr 10 18:44:18 <limelier>	i don't know about that, since i've never heard of it, but
Apr 10 18:44:22 <Ristovski>	savask: greetings comrade
Apr 10 18:44:24 <limelier>	hey, you probably know better
Apr 10 18:44:35 <Doxin>	what you can do is make sure the texture has 0 users, save your file, and then reload it. that deletes the texture
Apr 10 18:44:47 <Doxin>	anyways, seems that sort of nonsense is MUCH more visible when doing animation :P
Apr 10 18:44:58 <savask>	Ristovski: Zdravstvuyte tovarish
Apr 10 18:45:04 <Ristovski>	nice
Apr 10 18:45:55 <savask>	Ristovski: What's up?
Apr 10 18:53:01 <Ristovski>	savask: Nothing much, have some random crap to do and then I will try and implement something
Apr 10 18:53:10 <Ristovski>	>very vague
Apr 10 18:53:13 <savask>	Lol
Apr 10 18:53:21 <savask>	"Have something to do and then will do something"

Apr 10 20:14:02 <Ristovski>	savask: I have swap disabled
Apr 10 20:14:11 <Ristovski>	had it disabled even before
Apr 10 20:16:33 <savask>	I see
Apr 10 20:20:18 <Ristovski>	savask: I am truly "multitasking" now
Apr 10 20:21:13 <savask>	Ristovski: Sitting, watching the screen and typing at the same time?
Apr 10 20:21:49 <Ristovski>	savask: more like, 60+ tabs in chrome, 4 ffmpeg encode jobs and blender doing crap as well

Apr 10 20:58:54 <moony>	I wonder what happened to SopaXorzTaker. I noticed their github account disappeared when looking for tpt alchemy's src
Apr 10 20:59:09 <Doxin>	did it?
Apr 10 20:59:31 <moony>	yea
Apr 10 20:59:47 <Doxin>	odd
Apr 10 21:01:26 <moony>	on a different topic, i'm going to try and TAS TPT Alchemy for my amusement
Apr 10 21:02:17 <savask>	Lol
Apr 10 21:02:39 <savask>	moony: Sources should be still available, right?
Apr 10 21:03:20 <savask>	Oh, they are not
Apr 10 21:03:22 <moony>	I found a bakcup, but the source is gone.
Apr 10 21:03:26 <moony>	i made a fork of someone's backup
Apr 10 21:03:57 <Doxin>	well that's odd, I got some unprompted syslog lines dumped into my terminal
Apr 10 21:04:11 <savask>	moony: What's the last commit?
Apr 10 21:04:16 <Doxin>	"kernel:[12435.674093] Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 20 on CPU 5."
Apr 10 21:04:40 <moony>	https://github.com/aneesh4073/TPT-Alchemy/commit/9a593ce11536e2e683bc64a698399c0805ce77a1
Apr 10 21:04:52 <moony>	it's probably not up to date so it's possible newer fixes are just gone
Apr 10 21:05:40 <savask>	No, it's actually more up to day than my version, rofl
Apr 10 21:07:40 <savask>	moony: I mean, isn't TPT alchemy TAS just one save which produces all elements one by one?
Apr 10 21:08:02 <savask>	Hmm, I guess that won't work
Apr 10 21:08:08 <moony>	I've opted to define it as "series of inputs that unlocks all elements as fast as possible"
Apr 10 21:08:44 <savask>	moony: So no lua scripts drawing stuff?
Apr 10 21:09:03 <moony>	no. I'm running the game under a TASing tool instead.
Apr 10 21:09:04 <moony>	libTAS
Apr 10 21:09:17 <savask>	Ah
Apr 10 21:09:59 <savask>	Also speaking of Sopa, he left github since it was acquired by microsoft
Apr 10 21:10:04 <moony>	ah
Apr 10 21:10:05 <savask>	And I kinda forgot why he left #powder
Apr 10 21:10:26 <limelier>	because we got acquired by microsoft
Apr 10 21:10:29 <limelier>	haven't you heard?
Apr 10 21:11:32 <savask>	:O
Apr 10 21:23:31 <jacob1>	moony / savask: Yeah that commit moony linked is the latest source
Apr 10 21:23:37 <jacob1>	I'll upload it later if the original link is gone
Apr 10 21:24:26 <savask>	jacob1: Link to sopa's copy (i.e. original) is gone
Apr 10 21:24:29 <jacob1>	I was thinking of releasing a new version of TPT-Alchemy after 96.0 is out
Apr 10 21:24:34 <jacob1>	savask: yeah but I have it too
Apr 10 21:24:44 <savask>	I know
Apr 10 21:25:19 <savask>	jacob1: And I think there's no point in new TPT alchemy version
Apr 10 21:26:05 <savask>	There are a lot of dumb reactions in TPT alchemy which need to be redone, and I doubt you will do it
Apr 10 21:26:50 <jacob1>	why do you doubt that
Apr 10 21:27:43 <savask>	You don't seem to be working on TPT a lot these days
Apr 10 21:28:28 <jacob1>	yeah
Apr 10 21:28:42 <Doxin>	speaking of
Apr 10 21:28:44 <jacob1>	but if I were spending the time to update that mod, I would at least try to fix a few of the reactions to be more sensible
Apr 10 21:28:47 <Doxin>	jacob1: merged thorium yet?
Apr 10 21:29:02 <jacob1>	Doxin: did you check your PR, maybe the status has changed
Apr 10 21:29:29 <savask>	jacob1: In any case, if you indeed decide to make another version, call it differently like "jacob's TPT alchemy mod" or idk
Apr 10 21:30:09 <moony>	I'd be happy to help with updating TPT alch
Apr 10 21:30:09 <savask>	And I was thinking mostly about ETDR reactions
Apr 10 21:30:20 <jacob1>	yes, same
Apr 10 21:30:25 <jacob1>	savask: hmm, I was hoping to reuse the same thread / name. Do you not want that?
Apr 10 21:31:54 <savask>	jacob1: Meh whatever, old name and thread are fine I guess
Apr 10 21:32:17 <savask>	jacob1: Then add me to the repo devs when you start the mod, I might fix some reactions as well then
Apr 10 21:32:22 <jacob1>	savask: anyway you were correct that I might not do it. We'll see. But if I were doing it, I would definitely try to fix some of the reactions
Apr 10 21:32:33 <jacob1>	96.0 isn't out yet anyway
Apr 10 21:32:55 *	savask still has time to finish alcahest
Apr 10 21:33:06 <moony>	while trying to TAS tpt I noticed something annoying too
Apr 10 21:33:15 <moony>	buttons are considered pressed on mouse button release
Apr 10 21:33:27 <Doxin>	jacob1: not significantly :P
Apr 10 21:33:42 <Doxin>	I'm just impatient is all :P
Apr 10 21:33:44 <moony>	or rather, you have to press and release on the button and dragging your cursor away causes the press to fail
Apr 10 21:33:52 <moony>	which i guess makes sense
Apr 10 21:34:01 <Doxin>	moony: that's how all buttons work though
Apr 10 21:34:03 <moony>	but i keep messing it up frame advancing so i'm complaining anyways
Apr 10 21:34:16 <moony>	yes i know :p
Apr 10 21:34:16 <Doxin>	in basically any OS
Apr 10 21:34:26 <moony>	but i want to complain because I keep screwing it up :p
Apr 10 21:34:32 <Doxin>	I see
Apr 10 21:34:36 <moony>	it's not an actual issue
Apr 10 21:34:40 <moony>	i'm just annoyed lol
Apr 10 21:35:58 <Doxin>	fair enough :P
Apr 10 21:36:43 <savask>	Hmm, moony, you can create a TPT fuzzier as a byproduct
Apr 10 21:36:55 <savask>	I bet pressing some buttons in a weird order can crash TPT
Apr 10 21:37:40 <jacob1>	doubt it. Sure it may do fail to trigger expected actions, but it's not going to segfault
Apr 10 21:38:06 <jacob1>	I
Apr 10 21:38:07 <jacob1>	er
Apr 10 21:38:08 <savask>	jacob1: I did find a crash by fuzzying saves
Apr 10 21:38:19 <jacob1>	I've run tpt in 3fps before and it still functions
Apr 10 21:38:25 <savask>	But I forgot to fix corresponding bugs :C
Apr 10 21:38:32 <jacob1>	>:
Apr 10 21:38:33 <moony>	this is an actual frame advance, so possibly
Apr 10 21:38:48 <jacob1>	how long ago was that, and was it PsV or OPS format?
Apr 10 21:39:00 <jacob1>	PsV I don't trust at all, there could be crashes there
Apr 10 21:40:12 <savask>	That was 2 years ago
Apr 10 21:40:23 <savask>	And I deleted these "bad" saves :/
Apr 10 21:40:36 <jacob1>	ok, nothing has changed since then so its probably still there
Apr 10 21:41:08 <moony>	what i wouldn't trust is libtas save states because you cannot possibly trust what's literally saving a running program to disk to not have jank
Apr 10 21:41:18 <moony>	they do work but i wouldn't use them for fuzzing
