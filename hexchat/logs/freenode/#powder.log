Apr 01 13:45:35 <limelier>	Ristovski: i'm curious, you and savask seem to be playing Factorio every day. what's your save look like?
Apr 01 13:45:59 <Ristovski>	we've been made! self-destruct
Apr 01 13:46:09 <Ristovski>	limelier: spaghetti, but this time more organized
Apr 01 13:46:16 <limelier>	that's what they all say
Apr 01 13:46:30 <Ristovski>	not that big yet, we don't play /that/ much
Apr 01 13:46:33 <limelier>	how far along are you?
Apr 01 13:46:35 <limelier>	also, mods?
Apr 01 14:04:20 <Ristovski>	limelier: no mods, and we basically reached kovarex, so early mid-game
Apr 01 14:06:02 <limelier>	i see, neat
Apr 01 14:06:37 <limelier>	maybe you should give me the server info so i can drop in and turn all of your stone reserves into landfill and paths

Apr 01 18:26:20 <Ristovski>	savask: also he video has unbalanced audio :(
Apr 01 18:36:34 <Ristovski>	savask: still very interesting
Apr 01 18:38:02 <savask>	Ristovski: I linked it before I finished watching, and to be honest, it turned out to be less interesting than I thought
Apr 01 18:38:31 <Ristovski>	savask: lol
Apr 01 18:39:04 <savask>	Ristovski: It all can be summarized by "a scientist got shot with a beam in the brain. He survived but couldn't get medical help/pension afterwards because of bureaucracy. He returned to his work"
Apr 01 18:39:15 <Ristovski>	savask: yeah, lol

Apr 01 19:47:32 <savask>	Ristovski: As expected
Apr 01 19:59:11 <savask>	Ristovski: I wish you could click on a map and let your factorio character go there automatically
Apr 01 19:59:35 <Ristovski>	savask: spidertron be like
Apr 01 19:59:46 <savask>	Hmm, indeed
Apr 01 19:59:49 <Ristovski>	savask: wait can you command a spidertron if you get in it?
Apr 01 19:59:54 <savask>	Hmm
Apr 01 20:00:07 <savask>	I don't know, lol
Apr 01 20:00:34 <savask>	Ristovski: As far as I remember, you can build stuff out of remote-controlled spidertron, so there's little reason to sit in it
Apr 01 20:00:41 <savask>	>Avatar
Apr 01 20:02:49 <savask>	Ristovski: Is it intended that the blueprint can't be moved tile by tile?
Apr 01 20:03:05 <Ristovski>	savask: theres a setting to "lock it in a grid"
Apr 01 20:03:11 <Ristovski>	for easy tiling
Apr 01 20:03:29 <savask>	Right
Apr 01 20:03:33 <Ristovski>	savask: i guess you can turn it off by opening the blueprint
Apr 01 20:04:03 <savask>	Yeah, did that, thanks
Apr 01 20:04:13 <savask>	Aand it can't be flipped
Apr 01 20:05:00 <Ristovski>	savask: yeah, limited by the refineries having specific inputs, I think
Apr 01 20:05:15 <savask>	Ah, right
Apr 01 20:05:27 <savask>	That's unfortunate, really
Apr 01 20:17:16 <kou>	someone keeps dumping 60s hifi stuff at the local appliance container
Apr 01 20:18:09 <kou>	copped two philips 4 tracks, one in pretty good condition and one with a cut power cord and screws and pieces missing
