T 1617958685 18<22disdyakis18>	yea that sounds accurate - i also queued up a few months ago - maybe closer to a year ago now :o - and i think i was queued up for a couple of days and had to disconnect because i was going out of town for the weekend
T 1617958735 18<22disdyakis18>	so i think that's just how it is, and isn't unique to this week
T 1617958754 20<limelier>30	honestly, i can understand that these interviews are all powered by volunteers doing it for free and they're not going to be very fast
T 1617958762 20<limelier>30	that's fine
T 1617958790 20<limelier>30	i just wish there was a more sane way to queue up in a process that'll apparently take multiple days
T 1617958845 20<limelier>30	as it stands it's very a very limiting process
T 1617958893 20<limelier>30	to have to connect from home and stay online for days at a time... i guess it favors people who will be able to seed the most as well but it still doesn't seem that solid of a process
T 1617958894 18<22disdyakis18>	yea idk what the replacement would look like though - maybe once you get in you could spearhead an update :P
T 1617958955 20<limelier>30	i'm not sure either, perhaps keeping your spot in the queue for 24h and allowing you to retake it when you come online
T 1617958955 18<22disdyakis18>	it did take me a year into the pandemic to realize that sheltering in place, working from home, and not going on vacations is the perfect recipe for queueing up for this process
T 1617959001 20<limelier>30	the thing that stops me from just powering through things by leaving my laptop on for a week is the fact that i dual boot between linux and windows

T 1617959095 20<limelier>30	it sucks too because the strict interviewing rules prevent any reasonable alternatives for me too
T 1617959116 20<limelier>30	like using a ZNC, or booting up my old desktop without a screen and SSHing into it to queue
T 1617959223 18<26geraffs18>	my laptop and irc client is on 24/7 so it doesn't change anything for me

T 1617959271 18<26geraffs18>	hello
T 1617959274 18<22disdyakis18>	yea i'm curious the exact reasoning behind some of the irc rules because i'm not super familiar with irc and in general, i know very little about networking despite literally taking a course on it
T 1617959299 20<limelier>30	i'm guessing a lot of the rules are to ensure you don't sidestep the "interview from a home connection" rule
T 1617959301 18<27Kristophersson18>	so from the sound of this chat it should be safe to keep my laptop running in the queue while I go home to my parents over the weekend?
T 1617959305 20<limelier>30	probably
T 1617959345 20<limelier>30	disdyakis: what i mean is, i'm guessing people would use a vpn, or an SSH server, or something else to connect from their "home connection" while away from home
T 1617959416 18<27Kristophersson18>	I mean you aren't even allowed to use a remote desktop application to take the interview. to me it sounds like they're trying to make it purposfully make it hard to join.
T 1617959422 20<limelier>30	iunno. i understand being selective, and i'm thankful that RED even takes new users at all, but I do wish the process made a bit more... sense
T 1617959466 20<limelier>30	it doesn't really take a rocket scientist to not upload trash and keep up a good ratio
T 1617959488 20<limelier>30	to me it seems like the interview queuing process is way bigger of a hurdle than the interview itself
T 1617959492 18<22disdyakis18>	yea, i guess my specific question is, are the rules just written to gauruntee you're at home on your home connection, or is there other rationale behind banning setups where you are at home on your home connection, but want to protect yourself from disconnecting - like maybe there was an issue in the past with people being away from their computers but still being on irc?
T 1617959544 20<limelier>30	i doubt that, because as it stands there's nothing stopping you from just leaving your pc open and going somewhere else
T 1617959564 18<22disdyakis18>	yea because like, if the queue moves up while i'm sleeping that's essentially the same as if i had a znc on my home server to keep me in this room even if my desktop shut off so idk
T 1617959575 20<limelier>30	yeah
T 1617959608 18<22disdyakis18>	so, like i said, i'm curious what the rationale is - it does sound like the kind of rule one makes when a loophole was abused in the past
T 1617959608 20<limelier>30	i would understand the really strict connection rules if you could feasibly queue up in the morning and actually get interviewed by the evening
T 1617959636 20<limelier>30	but its not, and i can understand that. like they say, everyone who interviews volunteers to do it for free, they don't have that much free time to waste
T 1617959649 20<limelier>30	but in that case it sounds like maybe the queueing process shouldn't be so restrictive
T 1617959675 18<22disdyakis18>	yea - it's also totally possible it's just entrenched in the interview process
T 1617959694 20<limelier>30	maybe my hunch was right, and they are specifically trying to filter people who can't keep their pcs on all the time (to seed)
T 1617959696 18<22disdyakis18>	the red interview process up until the interview itself (which i have not yet taken) is identical to the what.cd one
T 1617959697 20<limelier>30	hm
T 1617959719 20<limelier>30	oh, i'm not familiar. this is my first private tracker interview
T 1617959722 18<27Kristophersson18>	I think it's mainly to combat cheaters. As to not make it easy for them to create duplicate accounts or whatever. But it's sad that that is at the cost of all the legitimate interested
T 1617959729 20<limelier>30	yeah
T 1617959739 20<limelier>30	it's a bit disheartening
T 1617959790 18<22disdyakis18>	yea it doesn't sound like it's to filter out people who can't seed as much because my home server is going to be my seedbox essentially because it has a wired connection to my router
T 1617959817 20<limelier>30	i guess i'll just stay queued here for a while and see if there's any news
T 1617959823 20<limelier>30	doubt i'll be getting to the front any time soon, though
T 1617959847 20<limelier>30	good luck to you, disdyakis. maybe you can get a better idea of what's going on when you get in
T 1617959999 18<27Kristophersson18>	limeliner you might want to try getting into other ones first, to get some experience and whatnot. I am on a bunch of general content trackers and I hope that'll help my interview. Just browse reddit.com/r/opensignups, where people post if their tracker has signups available. Many private trackers also recruit on other trackers, so that could also be a way for you to get into more exclusive ones. I believe you can use this tracker 
T 1617959999 18<27Kristophersson18>	for reference for another high-level tracker, though I don't remember which. So, can't hurt to get into a couple of private trackers. I definitely recommend blu, a great general content tracker, and losslessclub for music

T 1617960057 18<27Kristophersson18>	many trackers also require "proof", screenshots of your profile on another tracker, if you wish to sign up without an invite, so having a small collection definitely is an advantage
